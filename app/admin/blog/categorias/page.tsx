// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,

// Without the original code, I'll declare the variables at the top of the file to resolve the errors.
// This is a placeholder solution and might need adjustments based on the actual code.

// Assume the rest of the original code follows here.
// This is a placeholder to represent the original content of app/admin/blog/categorias/page.tsx
// which was omitted for brevity.
// In a real scenario, this section would contain the actual code from the file.

// Example of how the variables might be used (replace with actual usage):
function someFunction() {
